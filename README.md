# Jìzhōu Sans
A handwriting-y CJK sans-serif font, Jìzhōu Sans is loosely the counter-project of [LXGW Sans](https://github.com/lxgw/LxgwWenKai).

Many fonts are named after cities. Unfortunately, many of them are frivolous travel or inspiration, and few of them infuse the bitterness of people in a time and place.
